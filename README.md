# Quiz 8 jihe0254_9103_tut7

**This quiz will be completed in two parts.**  
While introducing the `imaging techniques` and `coding techniques` that inspired me, I will also apply the markdown knowledge I have learned.
# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My creative inspiration comes from the *Academy Award*-winning film:  
**Everything Everywhere All at Once**.

There is a Multiverse Scene in the film, while the protagonist’s point of view remains consistent, t the environments and character identities fracture across different universes, times, and spaces—shifting constantly and even transforming characters into trees, fruits, aliens, and more.

## Multiverse Scene:

| ![Alt1](assets/outdoorScene.png) | ![Alt2](assets/asArtwork.png) |
| ![Alt1](assets/asTree.png) | ![Alt2](assets/asFruits.png) |

I’d like to incorporate this creative approach into my project: keeping a core structure or perspective constant, while allowing all other elements to change as much as possible. This contrast can create a powerful sense of visual impact and narrative surprise.

- [Everything Everywhere All at Once - Slow Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2v7JK8c2fk)

>Note: This clip includes a few weird or creepy moments to highlight the multiverse concept, but the overall tone of the film is not horror. Please view with discretion.



# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
In the official p5.js examples, there is a 3D module demonstrating the use of ***orbit Control***. This feature allows users to zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel or pinch gestures on a touch screen, enabling elements to expand outward or contract inward around a central point, even with 3D rotation.

I think this effect—of expanding and collapsing around a stable center—can be combined with the multiverse concept explored in Part 1. Since the design concept in Part 1 also revolves around a relatively fixed central element, this technique aligns well with the overall structure.

This technique might be worth experimenting with in relation to my concept, as it could help enrich the visual dynamics.

# Summary & Reflection
**These are some of my initial thoughts. As the project progresses, I will continue to explore and learn new techniques, adjusting my direction along the way to refine and improve the final outcome.**
